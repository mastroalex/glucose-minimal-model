Glucose is essential for the life of human beings and its concentration in the blood is strictly regulated. Alterations in blood glucose indicate numerous pathologies and various clinical tests they are used for diagnosis.

The IVGTT test is a clinical exam that analyzes two important parameters such as the effectiveness of glucose and insulin sensitivity. Using a mathematical model, such as the minimum glucose model, it is possible to undertake both paths of prediction and identification.

Through the prediction it is possible to predict, starting from the knowledge of the parameters, the evolution temporal blood glucose. Once the accuracy of the model has been verified, it is also possible to start from data from an IVGTT test and to trace the estimate of the glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity parameters.
